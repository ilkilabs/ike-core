# Open Policy Agent

![OPA](ilke/images/logo-opa.png)

The Open Policy Agent (OPA) is an open source, general-purpose policy engine that enables unified, context-aware policy enforcement across the entire stack.
OPA is hosted by the Cloud Native Computing Foundation (CNCF) as a graduated project.

- See https://github.com/open-policy-agent/opa/releases for binary releases and changelogs.

# Want to integrate OPA?

- See https://pkg.go.dev/github.com/open-policy-agent/opa/rego to integrate OPA with services written in Go.
- See https://www.openpolicyagent.org/docs/latest/rest-api/ to integrate OPA with services written in other languages.

For concrete examples of how to integrate OPA with systems like Kubernetes, Terraform, Docker, SSH, and more, see https://www.openpolicyagent.org/ .


# How does OPA work?
OPA gives you a high-level declarative language to author and enforce policies across your stack.

With OPA, you define rules that govern how your system should behave. These rules exist to answer questions like:

- Can user X call operation Y on resource Z?
- What clusters should workload W be deployed to?
- What tags must be set on resource R before it's created?

# Gatekeeper

## How is Gatekeeper different from OPA?

Compared to using OPA with its sidecar kube-mgmt (aka Gatekeeper v1.0), Gatekeeper introduces the following functionality:

- An extensible, parameterized policy library
- Native Kubernetes CRDs for instantiating the policy library (aka "constraints")
- Native Kubernetes CRDs for extending the policy library (aka "constraint templates")
- Audit functionality

## Getting started

Check out the https://open-policy-agent.github.io/gatekeeper/website/docs/install/ to deploy Gatekeeper components to your Kubernetes cluster.

## Documentation

Please see the https://open-policy-agent.github.io/gatekeeper/website/docs/howto/ for more in-depth information.

## Policy Library

See the https://github.com/open-policy-agent/gatekeeper-library for a collection of constraint templates and sample constraints that you can use with Gatekeeper.

## Example

we’ll take a look at the policy deny unauthorized host paths.

### Why do we need this policy?

We want to restrict pods from accessing unauthorized paths. This is very important in scenarios where our application gets compromised. 
This policy prevents the attackers from accessing sensitive files from the compromised pod.

### Deny Unauthorized Host Paths

First, we have to make sure that the OPA Gatekeeper is set as the admission controller. This can be easily done by using the following command

```
kubectl apply -f https://raw.githubusercontent.com/open-policy-agent/gatekeeper/release-3.1/deploy/gatekeeper.yaml
```

Once done, we can start creating and applying the policies. We need two yaml files to implement an OPA policy. 
One is the ConstraintTemplate file and the other one is the constraint file. 
The constraint template contains the rego policy along with information regarding the type of parameters that will be used. 
The constraint file has the “kind” to which this policy affects (example: Pod or Service) and the parameter values that we’ll provide.

## template.yaml
```
apiVersion: templates.gatekeeper.sh/v1beta1

            allowedPaths := get_allowed_paths(input)
            input_hostpath_violation(allowedPaths, volume)
            msg := sprintf("HostPath volume %v is not allowed, pod: %v. Allowed path: %v", [volume, input.review.object.metadata.name, allowedPaths])
        }
        input_hostpath_violation(allowedPaths, volume) {
            # An empty list means all host paths are blocked
            allowedPaths == []
        }
        input_hostpath_violation(allowedPaths, volume) {
            not input_hostpath_allowed(allowedPaths, volume)
        }
        get_allowed_paths(arg) = out {
            not arg.parameters
            out = []
        }
        get_allowed_paths(arg) = out {
            not arg.parameters.allowedHostPaths
            out = []
        }
        get_allowed_paths(arg) = out {
            out = arg.parameters.allowedHostPaths
        }
        input_hostpath_allowed(allowedPaths, volume) {
            allowedHostPath := allowedPaths[_]
            path_matches(allowedHostPath.pathPrefix, volume.hostPath.path)
            not allowedHostPath.readOnly == true
        }
        input_hostpath_allowed(allowedPaths, volume) {
            allowedHostPath := allowedPaths[_]
            path_matches(allowedHostPath.pathPrefix, volume.hostPath.path)
            allowedHostPath.readOnly
            not writeable_input_volume_mounts(volume.name)
        }
        writeable_input_volume_mounts(volume_name) {
            container := input_containers[_]
            mount := container.volumeMounts[_]
            mount.name == volume_name
            not mount.readOnly
        }
        # This allows "/foo", "/foo/", "/foo/bar" etc., but
        # disallows "/fool", "/etc/foo" etc.
        path_matches(prefix, path) {
            a := split(trim(prefix, "/"), "/")
            b := split(trim(path, "/"), "/")
            prefix_matches(a, b)
        }
        prefix_matches(a, b) {
            count(a) <= count(b)
            not any_not_equal_upto(a, b, count(a))
        }
        any_not_equal_upto(a, b, n) {
            a[i] != b[i]
            i < n
        }
        input_hostpath_volumes[v] {
            v := input.review.object.spec.volumes[_]
            has_field(v, "hostPath")
        }
        # has_field returns whether an object has a field
        has_field(object, field) = true {
            object[field]
        }
        input_containers[c] {
            c := input.review.object.spec.containers[_]
        }
        input_containers[c] {
            c := input.review.object.spec.initContainers[_]
        }
```

We can apply the ConstraintTemplate 

```
kubectl apply -f template.yaml
```


## constraint.yaml

```
apiVersion: constraints.gatekeeper.sh/v1beta1
kind: K8sPSPHostFilesystem
metadata:
  name: psp-host-filesystem
spec:
  match:
    kinds:
      - apiGroups: [""]
        kinds: ["Pod"]
  parameters:
    allowedHostPaths:
    - readOnly: true
      pathPrefix: "/foo"
```

We can apply the constraint after we have applied the template.

```
kubectl apply -f constraint.yaml
```

Once the template and the constraint have been applied, our policy is in place.

## example-disallowed.yaml
```
apiVersion: v1
kind: Pod
metadata:
  name: nginx-host-filesystem
  labels:
    app: nginx-host-filesystem-disallowed
spec:
  containers:
  - name: nginx
    image: nginx
    volumeMounts:
    - mountPath: /cache
      name: cache-volume
      readOnly: true
  volumes:
  - name: cache-volume
    hostPath:
      path: /tmp # directory location on host
```

This will get denied as the pod is trying to access “/tmp” which is not allowed.

## example-allowed.yaml

```
apiVersion: v1
kind: Pod
metadata:
  name: nginx-host-filesystem
  labels:
    app: nginx-host-filesystem-allowed
spec:
  containers:
  - name: nginx
    image: nginx
    volumeMounts:
    - mountPath: /cache
      name: cache-volume
      readOnly: true
  volumes:
  - name: cache-volume
    hostPath:
      path: /foo # directory location on host
```

This will get created without any issues as the hostPath is allowed to be accessed by the pod.
